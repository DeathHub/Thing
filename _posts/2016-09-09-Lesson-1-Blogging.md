    <td>Making sure I did not interact with others for most of the lesson until I needed help. This made sure I stayed on task for the whole lesson and therefore got quite far during the lesson. Not taking helped immensely because I knew what I needed to do and I did not forget.</td>

    <td>Nothing limited my learning this lesson since I made sure to remove any distractions from my mind. During the lesson this is shown by where I chose to sit.</td>
